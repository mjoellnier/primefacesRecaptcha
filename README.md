This is the altered primefaces sample project (https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces-test) to showcase that the invisible reCaptcha isn't working. The project is altered in such a way that it is running on PrimeFaces 6.2. On Button press "I'm working" should be printed on the console out. But this only is happening when the captcha is not active. 

You can execute the sample with <strong>mvn jetty:run</strong> command and hit <strong>http://localhost:8080/primefaces-test</strong> to run the page.
